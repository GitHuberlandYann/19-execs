# 19-execs
Executables for my fellow 19 students to playtest my projects without having to compile them.

## About
On the campus 19, we have access to computers with limited resources, which take a lot of time to compile some projects (eg glm), and that's not accounting for the time installing cmake takes.

It makes it difficult to gather feedbacks when needed. Which is why you are reading this text right now, I display campus_19_macs_compatible executables here for everyone to enjoy. If you wish to try them out on another computer, feel free to navigate my github to the desired projects and build the executables from scratch. Cheers.
